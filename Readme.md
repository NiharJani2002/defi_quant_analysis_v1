## 💡 What I Learned

Building this project deepened my expertise in **bridging quantitative finance with web development**:

### 📊 Data Visualization Mastery
- Selected optimal chart types: **scatter plots** for correlation analysis, **doughnut charts** for portfolio composition, **line charts** for time-series projections
- Designed interactive parameters (sliders, toggles) enabling real-time model exploration without backend recalculation
- Implemented responsive layouts ensuring clarity across devices

### 🧮 Quantitative Finance Implementation
- Translated academic models (Kelly Criterion, Sharpe ratios, Monte Carlo simulations) into **production JavaScript**
- Built regime-weighted ensemble pricing engines with beta sensitivity adjustments
- Maintained mathematical rigor: p-value thresholds (< 0.01), correlation matrices, statistical significance testing

### 🏗️ Code Architecture
- Structured 2000+ line HTML artifacts with clean separation: **data models → visualization logic → UI components**
- Embedded complete Python implementations with error handling, rate limiting, connection pooling
- Achieved zero-dependency deployment (pure vanilla JS + CDN resources)

### 🎨 UX for Complex Analysis
- Transformed intimidating statistical frameworks into **approachable, educational interfaces**
- Created "analyst voice" commentary explaining model decisions in plain language
- Balanced technical depth with accessibility for diverse audiences
